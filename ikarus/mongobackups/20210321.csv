Journey into the modern WebDev,"This website has been an attempt to get familiar with creating a somewhat modern website, with all the fancy packages and methodologies. It's using the Nuxt framework which compiles various packages together (VueJS, Vuetify, NodeJS ...) and stores data on MongoDB. 

I've always been pretty scared of delving into webdev, from the outside it seems like a never-ending well of knowledge domains, and over-complicated and over-engineered solutions to simple problems. This has certainly been my case when making this app. I tried to keep extra package dependencies to a minimum, as it seems like everything is stitched together, I'm imagining a rickety house on an unstable foundation.
I think it's pretty akin to using a game engine, where there are many conveniences afforded to you at the cost of hiding the underlying workings. It can do straightforward things very quickly, however if you need a specific feature, you'll end up fighting with the engine to get things done. You have to figure out the black box, and massage it to do what you want. The added complexity with web frameworks is the multitude of third party packages to choose from, it isn't like a game engine in that regard since it doesn't give you everything from the start. 
All this is baffling since the reason for using a game engine is helping with the complexity involved in creating 3D games, all the matrix mathematics, quaternions, rendering involved. 
However what we're primarily dealing with when creating websites is text. Delivering text shouldn't be so complicated.",2021-03-15 4:6:31
Jason Rohrer pokes the bear,"Recently the indie dev Jason Rohrer, creator of the game Passage and most recently One Hour One Life, has been in a bit of a doozy. He's selling artwork without the artist's consent via a method that damages the environment. That's a pretty shocking turn of events from someone much adored for his indie game trailblazing. But maybe that statement tells us more about the surrounding media climate rather than the truth.
Example 1:
https://kotaku.com/game-artists-not-happy-that-developer-is-selling-their-1846465316

What is actually happening is that he's selling digital signatures for pieces of public domain pixel art that he commissioned for the game Castle Doctrine. This the most recent blockchain craze called NFTs (non-fungible tokens) whereby people are able to create unalterable strings containing metadata to something, these can be licenses to physical things such as serial codes of baseball cards, in this case it was an url to a page hosting the .jpg images. They are then auctioning off these essentially worthless things to try to make a quick buck. In short Jason Rohrer is poking fun, and perhaps also trying to cash in on this. To me, it feels like just a silly joke that's in part commentary on people's notion of value, which kind of also fits into the original game, Castle Doctrine, which is about breaking and entering and stealing things. A small thing about an ethical gray area with no ill intent.
Some people are having a problem with how much power is required for the ethereum blockchain whereby these NFTs are traded. But who's to say what has value. The other issue is accreditation and selling other people's artwork without their knowledge. That gets a bit more complicated, if I were to commission a piece of work from you, do you have a say in what I do with it? Don't I now own it? In any case it was an oversight on Jason Rohrer's part in not asking the original artists for their consent to participate in the joke, he's since removed any unhappy participants.

This is interesting and got me to look at the twitter flame war that broke out due to this:

Lot's of virtue signalling and shaming for what I think to be a pretty innocuous thing. This eventually led me to another, perhaps more serious turn of events that occurred surrounding his other game One Hour One Life, a tale of fraud, personal principles being tested, and a ripoff being more popular than the original :

Let me try to summarize. Jason Rohrer is a pretty peculiar individual, he puts all his games into the public domain. What this means is that all the source code, art is publicly available with no copyright:
https://github.com/jasonrohrer
This is pretty problematic especially if you're trying to sell your works. However he is steadfast in his beliefs, which is outlined here:
http://hcsoftware.sourceforge.net/jason-rohrer/freeDistribution.html
It's pretty admirable, if not a bit naive. But it works for him. One Hour One Life was able to turn a profit by selling accounts with access to the server where he's hosting the game. Since that's the official server and it's an MMO game, the account is pretty much required for you to play the game. But that doesn't stop anyone else from hosting a server and charging for access. What happened was someone saw an opportunity and ported the game for mobile, which became more popular than the original game. The mobile developers were pretty transparent with Jason from the onset, however when they release the game in China there was no attribution to the original game by the publisher, which along with more people actually playing in China than those that played the original game resulted in the majority of people's first hand experience with the game being not the original vision Jason intended. 
Arguments were slung back and forth in the forums, however due to the public domain nature of the IP, there was no legal recourse Jason could take. And he didn't want to anyways. The sum of which is this post:

This has been going on for more than four days, and I have more pressing matters to attend to (family, GDC talk, more OHOL updates).  So, at this point, I guess I give up.

I have withdrawn my dispute submissions from Apple, Google, and TapTap.

I feel like a great deal of damage has already been done to my legacy and reputation as a designer, and an unfathomable amount of additional damage will be done in the future, if the current course with the mobile adaptation isn't altered.  I can imagine a situation in the future where OHOL becomes widely known, but the vast majority of people in the world mistakenly believe that the mobile version is the original version, and that DualDecade alone authored it, or that I am part of DualDecade, and that I approved the changes that they have made.  If that comes to pass, that situation will haunt me for the rest of my life.  We're pretty close to that already, at least in China and Japan.

One Hour One Life is the biggest project that I've ever worked on, and the one that I'm most proud of, and also the most personal.  My pen-and-ink drawings, my watercolor backgrounds, my characters, my voice making all the sounds, and my soul poured into the piano music, which I improvised in one take, directly from the heart.  A love letter to the world and to humanity, from where I sit at age 41, half-way through my life, as my three boys transform into men right before my eyes, and as I pass from being the main character in my own story to a supporting role in the stories of other people.

You can all understand how terrible it is for anyone out there who plays and enjoys the game to not understand where the game came from, or think that other people made it, or think that I put Santa Claus in it.

That said, I don't think copyright is the right tool to prevent such harms.  The truth does not expire after limited terms.  The truth doesn't change or become irrelevant 70 years after the death of the author.  The truth doesn't need copyright.  The truth just needs people who are willing to tell it.

The truth now, for whoever is willing to tell it, is that the mobile version has gone from ""unofficial and not specifically approved"" to ""specifically unapproved and directly against my wishes as the original creator,"" only because of the way that its presentation has misled people in the past, and will continue to mislead people in the future, in its current form.

Hopefully, Christoffer, you will be willing to correct this, and prevent additional harm to my legacy, in a way that you can live with.

I've given you four years of my life and creative output, allowed you to build a successful commercial product using that output, and asked for nothing in return.  Nothing but the truth.  That's on you now.

But as for me, I'm out.
